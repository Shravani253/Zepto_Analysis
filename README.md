Key highlights of the project:

🗂️ Dataset: Zepto data in CSV format prepared for SQL-based exploration and analysis.

🛠️ SQL Analysis: Real-time business questions and scenarios addressed directly using SQL queries and clauses (e.g., aggregations, filtering, joins, groupings).

📊 Business Insights: Extracted meaningful trends and metrics from the data to understand operations and performance in a real-world business context.

🔍 Focus Areas: Query-based insights into customer behavior, order patterns, sales performance, and other operational aspects.

This project demonstrates how SQL can be effectively applied to real datasets to answer business-critical questions and derive actionable insights.
